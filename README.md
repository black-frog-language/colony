# colony
You can colonize the computer as europeans once did

## INTRODUCTION ##
Colony is a stupid tool that you can do something in your file system.You can use it on April Fool's Day,to hack other's computer or public computer.First I want to do this because my classmate @ trustgit want to copy a very funny vedio on our school computer.So I made a windows version. But you must be a administrator.

The first version was called "Quentin". It can copy a file in each dictionary.

But now , the project"colony" is more like a history simulator.In different dictionary, you can do different things.

## COMMAND ##
Colony has some command,they are used to copy many things:  
gui ------------------------------to get the GUI
copy {dictionary} {dictionary} ---to copy a dictionary in another
colonize {file} {dictionary} -----to copy a file in every dictionary
